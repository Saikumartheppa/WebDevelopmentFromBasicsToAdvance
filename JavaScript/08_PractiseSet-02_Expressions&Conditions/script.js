// 1. Use Logical operators to find whether the age of person lies between 10 and 20 ?

/* let age = 12;
if(age >= 10 && age <= 20){
    console.log("the age " , age , "lies between 10 and 20" );
}
else{
    console.log("the age " , age , "not lies between 10 and 20" );
}*/

// 2. Demonstrate the use of switch case statements in JS

/*
let bike = "Honda -220sf";
switch(bike){
    case 'RX-100' :
    console.log(bike , "Available");
    break;
    case "Honda -220sf":
    console.log(bike , "Available");
    break;
    default : 
    console.log(bike, "Not Avialable") 
}
*/

// 3.Write a JS program to find whether the number is divisible by 2 & 3

 /* let num = 23;
if(num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 == 0){
    console.log("The given number ", num , "is divisible by 2 & 3");
}
else if(num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 != 0){
    console.log("The given number ", num , "is divisible by 2 , but not divisible by 3");
}
else if(num % 2 != 0 && num % 3 == 0){
    console.log("The given number ", num , "is divisible by 3 , but not divisible by 2");
}else{
    console.log("The given number ", num , "is not divisible by 2 & 3");
} */

// 4.Write a JS program to find whether the number is divisible either by 2 or 3

/*let n = 21
if(n % 2 == 0 || n % 3 == 0){
   console.log("The given number ", n ," the number is divisible either by 2 or 3") 
}
else{
    console.log("The given number ", n ," the number is not divisible either by 2 or 3") 
}  */

// 5.Print "you can drive" or  "you can't drive" based on age being greater than 18 using ternary operator
/*
 let age = 120;
 age = age < 18 ? "You can't drive" : "You can drive";
console.log(age) 
*/
